: The visibility of images is often compromised by low-light conditions, backlighting, and low contrast.  Techniques such as histogram equalization and near-infrared (NIR)-visible fusion are commonly employed to mitigate these challenges . However, histogram equalization frequently results in detail loss and oversaturation, while pairing images in NIR-visible fusion remains complex and error-prone.  This study presents a novel method to address these limitations effectively.  The proposed algorithm leverages CycleGAN to generate synthetic NIR images, blended twice with visible images, to achieve tone-compression effects, substantially minimizing detail loss and oversaturation . This innovative approach enhances image quality while overcoming the inherent drawbacks of traditional methods . The results demonstrate that images generated using our method outperform conventional algorithms in terms of quality. This advancement holds significant potential for applications in various domains, particularly self-driving vehicles and CCTV surveillance systems, where reliable image clarity is paramount.
